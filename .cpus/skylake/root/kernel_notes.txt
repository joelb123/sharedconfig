Kernels in this setup are designed to be shared across all computers
with this architecture and CPU.  The kernel therefore needs to be
inclusive rather than inclusive.  The choice was made to generate
desktop rather than server configurations.

Use the command "generate_kernel" to issue the build command.  On
client machines this will complete automatically.  On CPU servers
the choices for the architecture need to be defined.

The following non-default choices in the kernel configuration menu
have been made as of kernel version 5.9.9:
