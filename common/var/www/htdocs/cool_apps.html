<h2 style="text-align: center;">Other Cool Apps</h2>
<br>
By this point you should have set up your desktop and browser.
&nbsp; There are some applications that are worth mentioning.<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">autofs</span> This&nbsp; system
application automatically mounts NFS directories when needed, then
dismounts them after a period of inactivity.&nbsp; This tends to make
cross-mounting more stable, especially when a machine goes down.&nbsp;
There are two directories where this happens.&nbsp; Any reference to
/home/hostname will mount /export/home on host hostname.&nbsp; The
other is more magical: /net/hostname will show all the exported
directories from hostname. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">samba</span> This application
handles communication with Windows machines.&nbsp; This host is
configured to export /home/${HOSTNAME}/share as a Windows share that
should be read/write available to Windows clients on your local
network.&nbsp; You can also use Samba to browse exported filesystems on
Windows hosts.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">apache</span> The http daemon
will serve any files you put in your <code>public_html</code>
subdirectory under http://localhost/~username/.&nbsp; You can also put
files in /var/www/localhost/htdocs.&nbsp; It is possible to arrange an
alias with the LANL hostmaster and have this host act as a virtual
server for a project under http://myprojectname.lanl.gov where
"myprojectname" is the name of an arbitrary project.</li>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">thunderbird</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">evolution</span> These two mail programs go
far beyond terminal-based applications and are particularly good at
handling those MS Word files and the like that people insist on
sending.&nbsp; Thunderbird is perhaps the more popular, although I use
Evolution with the lab mail systems and like it. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">scipy</span> The <a
 href="http://www.scipy.org">scipy</a> scientific tools for python are
installed.&nbsp; These bind a lot of useful science and math libraries
(LAPACK, gnuplot, image processing, and more) to the programming
language python, and is particularly good for making
publication-quality figures from data.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">nxclient</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">nxserver&nbsp; </span>These make secure
remote X11 desktop connections to other machines.&nbsp; The speed of
the connections is surprisingly good.&nbsp; Free clients are available
for Windows&nbsp; machines.&nbsp; As a client, it's a great way to
connect to a compute server in another room or building and have a full
desktop available.&nbsp; As a server (after some <a
 href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/nx-guide.xml">NX server
configuration</a>) it's a good way to connect to a Linux desktop from a
Windows laptop.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">pdflatex</span> Insert the
command <code>\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}</code> into your Latex
files and use the pdflatex command instead of latex to produce pdf
files that are better for e-mailing and of equal quality for paper
prints.&nbsp; The one catch is that any included graphics must also be
in PDF format.&nbsp; If you are a gnuplot user, this is best done by
producing eps files using the postscript driver and filtering them to
PDF with the command <code>epstopdf --compress --outfile=figureX.pdf
figureX.eps</code>.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">inkster</span> You've probably
heard of GIMP, which is a bitmap editor similar to PhotoShop, but you
may not be familiar with this Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) drawing
editor.&nbsp; Drawings produced by inkster may be included in web
sites&nbsp; and are good at any resolution.&nbsp; They may also be used
with LaTex in figures for publications.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">computational biology tools</span>
Emboss, Embassy, NCBI-tools, gromacs, and lots more.&nbsp; Look in
/usr/portage/sci-biology for the names of packages or use the esearch
command to look for others.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">office tools</span> OpenOffice
and KOffice are both installed.&nbsp; Each contains a full set of
office applications (word processor, drawing, presentations,
etc.)&nbsp; I prefer OpenOffice at this time.<br>
