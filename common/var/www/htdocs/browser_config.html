<h2 style="text-align: center;">Quick-Config for your Desktop &amp;
Browser</h2>
<br>
Your desktop and browser will look better and work better if you take a
few simple steps to configure them.&nbsp; I have made these changes to
/etc/skel so they may already be done automatically (if you used
superadduser!).<br>
<h4>System Configuration&nbsp;</h4>
<ol>
  <li>If you're not gonna log in to the root account at least once a
week, go to <code>/etc/mail </code>and put add an e-mail account that
you monitor to the root alias, and then issue the command <code>newaliases</code>.&nbsp;
This way important system messages will be seen promptly.</li>
  <li>If you have an additional display device such as a second monitor
or a projector attached, you may wish to use a different <code>xorg.conf</code>.&nbsp;
Several are provided in <code>/etc/X11</code>, and I suggest you make
a symbolic link to the closest version.&nbsp; You may need to edit the
files and change the BusIDs to match what lspci shows you is correct
for your graphics card.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The resolution density (in dpi) of your monitor has been set to
85dpi, which is correct for a 19" LCD monitor, but may need to be
adjusted if you have a monitor much larger or smaller.&nbsp; You can
change this by modifying the following line in <code>/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf:
command=/usr/X11R6/bin/X -dpi 85 -audit 0.</code>&nbsp; (It is
preferable to set this resolution directly than let X choose the
resolution, as the horizontal and vertical rarely match, which makes
fonts look bad).</li>
  <li>Your graphics card may support full-screen anti-aliasing and
texture filtering, both of which make 3-D object look better at the
cost of some performance.&nbsp; I have left them turned off, but if you
wish to turn them on, edit <code>/etc/env.d/03opengl-attributes </code>and
follow the instructions listed there.&nbsp; You can also leave them to
be turned on per-user or per-session.&nbsp; You'll probably want to
test the settings by loading your favorite protein with <code>vmd</code>;
you may also want to run the <code>nvidia-settings</code>
program&nbsp; to adjust colors and play with overclocking.&nbsp; I do
not know how to make settings from the program permanent, as they seem
optimal as configured.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Per-user configuration</h4>
Use the <code>superadduser</code> script to add users to the
system.&nbsp;
It&nbsp;
which will prompt you for any needed info, with reasonable
defaults.&nbsp; The proper home directory is
/home/${HOSTNAME}/username.&nbsp; The user used be added to groups
audio, cdrom, cdrw, users, video, and wheel.&nbsp; It is good practice
to
coordinate user ID numbers across any systems this account will log
into.&nbsp; If you use superadduser, it should copy a set of files with
good defaults from /etc/skel, but in case something goes wrong, here
are the steps needed to configure a new user account from scratch:<br>
<ol>
  <li>You can choose either Gnome or KDE as your default window manager
at login time.&nbsp; Each has its advantages.</li>
  <li>Choose some nice default fonts <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>for
your desktop.&nbsp; In your window manager, bring up a font
preferences dialog (in Gnome this is done by Desktop -&gt; Preferences
-&gt; Font, in KDE this is done via Konqueror, under <code>Control
Center -&gt;Appearance &amp; Themes -&gt; Fonts</code>).&nbsp; The
default fonts on Gnome are set to Sans, but most
people find that another family looks better and is more
readable.&nbsp; KDE starts off looking better, but you may want to
change it anyway. You should pick a family is that is complete in that
is
has a <span style="font-weight: bold;">bold, </span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">italic,&nbsp; </span><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">fixed width, </span>and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">bold italic</span></span></span> variant
available.&nbsp; Bitstream Vera, Lucida, and Nimbus Sans are all
popular choices.&nbsp; Personally, I find the Bitstream Vera most
readable for
the proportional fonts, but I prefer Terminus for the monospaced
terminal fonts (which is what I look at the most).&nbsp; As you choose
the fonts and sizes, your desktop will reflect the changes.&nbsp; You
will also want to click on "subpixel smoothing" if you are using an LCD
display.</li>
  <li>You will probably want to add a terminal icon to the list of
frequently-used applications on the window manager panel.&nbsp; In
Gnome, this is done by Applications-&gt;System Tools-&gt;Terminal
(right-click) Add this launcher to panel.&nbsp;&nbsp; You might also
want to do this to firefox-bin, which is under Applications -&gt;
Internet -&gt; Mozilla Firefox (bin).</li>
  <li>Choose a desktop background that you like.&nbsp; In Gnome, this
is done through Desktop-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Desktop Background.&nbsp;
If you wish to add background images of your own, they can be added via
the "Add Backgrounds" menu here.&nbsp; In KDE, this is done
through&nbsp; (right-click)-&gt;Configure Desktop-&gt;Background.&nbsp;
Images of your own may be added under "Picture:" using the browse
option.</li>
  <li>Start Firefox, if you haven't already.&nbsp; You may choose other
fonts for your browser by clicking on
Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Appearance-&gt;Fonts (in firefox &amp;
mozilla).&nbsp; I find the default fonts are better than most other
choices, though.&nbsp; Click on this
link to download <a href="../../../../2HHB.pdb">a
PDB file</a>; the browser should ask whether you want to open it with
VMD, if not, click the "Browse" button and choose <code>/usr/local/bin/vmd
    </code>(or <code>/usr/bin/rasmol</code> if you prefer).&nbsp;
You will probably want to leave "Always ask" checked to prevent
clicking through to potentially harmful files.&nbsp; Next, do the same
steps after clicking on the <a href="../../../../vmd-demo/">VMD demo
page</a>,
but this time the helper files is <code>/usr/local/bin/vmdexec.sh</code>.&nbsp;
Be aware that VMD is NOT running in any sandbox in this mode, so any
damaging scripts can affect your system.&nbsp; Sound, java, flash, and
most types of video files should be
working with Firefox as configured. A convenient place to test video
files is at <a href="http://cnn.com/">CNN</a>.&nbsp; If you use other
browsers such as Konqueror or Epiphany, you may wish to do the same for
them (although they will probably not work properly with extensions
such as Java and video unless you do some extensive configuration).</li>
  <li>Start the Configuration Editor (found under
Applications-&gt;System Tools) and check that
system-&gt;gstreamer-&gt;0.8-&gt;default has the following settings:
audiosink=alsasink, audiosrc=alsasrc, videosink=ximagesink,
videosrc=v4lsrc.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
